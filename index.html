	  <h2>Introduction</h2>
	  </div>
		<p> “All ah we is one” is a statement commonly used in the region to promote a sense of togetherness of the islands in the region. Although the islands of the region are bound by some common ideas, for example history and culture, many steps such as the establishment of CXC, CSME and the WICB have been put in place to bring them together.  It is always difficult to describe the Caribbean because there is no one definition that completely describes the Caribbean region due to its complexity. Geographically, the Caribbean may be defined as a mass of islands which are in the Caribbean Sea or the islands which shores are washed by the Caribbean Sea. Geologically the Caribbean can be defined as the area which sits on the Caribbean plate bound by both the Atlantic and Nazca plate. The historical definition is that it is the area which exists because of the of the exploitation and colonization of the Europeans.

				<h2>Slavery</h2>
			</div>
			<p>
				Common historical experiences, influenced through slavery, led to common culture in the Caribbean region.  Caribbean identity can be considered as a composition of the cultures of the Caribbean which were first made in the region and cultures brought to the region. These include the different beliefs and ideologies of people. For many years, the Caribbean region has been made up of different types of societies which have their own separate cultures. The settling of the colonizers several years ago, led to the development of the cultures due to them forcing their genetics and beliefs on the enslaved. Several of the current inhabitants of the region are offspring from slaves who came from Africa via the slave trade in the 17th century.  This greatly influenced the cultures of the Caribbean and according to Beckford (1972) the internal and external dynamics of the plantation system dominate countries’ economic, social and political structure.  Even today in the region we can see the impacts of the structure put in place in the contemporary region. 
 This can be noted as the basis for the unification of the region’s islands because it connected members of the past society which shared many structural similarities.  Similarities included the practices such as religion, basic lifestyle practices and laws which would have been exhibited and learned through different generations. These cultures greatly differed from those worldwide which differentiated the different groups. Islands of the Caribbean were colonized by several European giants in the past such as the Dutch and Portuguese. Because of the structural similarities that the islands of the region have been put under, many of the islands have a similar culture which can cause them to be united or segregated. These European colonizers brought to the islands of the region their fellow countrymen as well as slaves which were used to replace the population of indigenous people across the islands (Allahar 1993). This meant that there would have been a great influence of the European culture. They created new laws which were put in place to rule the people. They also brought with them their own religion which is why many islands of the Caribbean region have similar religious beliefs. These structures put in place were used as a type of control mechanism to reduce the cultural expression of the slaves giving us the Caribbean identity, we all possess today. As slaves became more educated, they fought together for better treatment. This showed a sense of unity amongst people as they fought for a common goal supporting “all ah we is one”.  This led to a point where the cost of maintaining these slaves became too much and this resulted in the emancipation of slaves giving them rights and freedom to rule themselves. This led some of them to settle in different parts of the region creating communities and forming the contemporary societies. Indentured laborers were also brought to the region to replace the African slaves.  Indentured labourers included Chinese, Syrians and East Indians who were prominent in Guyana and Trinidad. This immigration led to the Caribbean being what it is today because of a plethora of different cultures and values being brought together and infused in us further supporting the statement “All ah we is one”. 
This would have led to the formation of the creole theory by Kamau Brathwaite which says that different cultures will merge to create one. In the island Trinidad this can be seen where there are many different cultures and religions who live together and celebrate each other’s cultures.

			  <h2>Colorism </h2>
			  </div>
				<p> Colorism is the social theory which deals with the   discrimination or prejudice associated with persons within the same race. This is commonly thought to have come about due to colonialism and can be considered as a social disease. Colorism was mainly carried out by persons with a Caucasian ethnicity and this act was carried out on the African enslaved and indigenous people. Some of the slave owners got sexually active with the enslaved and thus produced offspring. Many years after slavery these descendants of Europeans such as: mulattos, mixed and creoles are present today. These mixed persons altered the social hierarchy with them being below the white elite slave masters but above the black slaves thus they were perceived to have more opportunities than the blacks. These people are referred to by names such as Eckey Becky, Red Necks or even Poor Whites. In Barbados, these persons represented a new class where they were neither considered to be black or white; with many of them have lighter skin colours. They did not have privileges of the white elite as they were not claimed by them and they were rejected by and not claimed to be dark as they was a belief that because they were of a lighter complexion they would enjoy more privileges because of their ‘rank’ in society. This greatly influenced the way in which these persons were treated and has caused these things to be forever etched in the identity of the Caribbean people. This could be seen in recent years where Barbadians have been outright discriminatory to Guyanese residents often telling them “guh back where yuh come from” this was due to the belief by Barbadians that the Guyanese would come to take away their jobs although they were more qualified than they. Colorism is a social pandemic which is continuously recycled and forever etched in the minds of our people. It has caused long lasting scars in our hearts and minds which only we as one people can stop.

					<h2>Education</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					At the educational level, the islands of the region have unified under one common body breaking away from the shackles of colonization. That body is the Caribbean examinations (CXC) which was established in the year 1972. This was a move away from the past system of the General Certificate of Education (GCE) which was used by some of the islands.  This further progressed the act of decolonization with the addition of another regional body. The formation of this council meant that students throughout the regional territories would be able be able to sit common examinations such as Caribbean Secondary Certificate Examinations (CSEC) and Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination (CAPE). Over the years, the CXC council has achieved recognition, credibility in the region and abroad. CXC has employed a wide range of persons from different cultures. Additionally, attaining specific grades in CAPE allows for some students to receive scholarships by their government to study at the universities within the region; thus, enhancing the unity of the region.
					In the year 1948, the University of the West Indies (UWI) was established with its first branch at Mona Jamaica. Throughout the years, UWI has expanded with the addition of two campuses: Cavehill in Barbados, St Augustine in Trinidad, and the Open campus. The expansion of certain programmes at the differing campuses has encouraged persons from different islands throughout the region to attend campuses outside their home island to fulfil their needs in terms of areas of study. This has led to the infusion or merging of different cultures as the creole theory suggests. Students and lecturers alike interact with different persons from many islands and form long-lasting relations which are the backbone of our contemporary society.

				  <h2>Culture </h2>
				  </div>
				  <h3>Sports</h3>
					<p> Sports, especially the game of cricket is another aspect of culture, playing an immense role in the unification of the region allowing us to say, “All ah we is one.” The West Indies Cricket board (WICB) has brought pride to the region. The WICB was a success for the region with regards to the integration of players who are selected from different islands.  The players then forge friendships and share in the cultures of different islands bringing “all ah we” together as one region - one collective nation. Fans of the game would travel from island to island to enjoy the game. Even the introduction of the Caribbean Premier League has again enforced unity and embraced the identity of our region by bringing cricketers from the various islands together to make a team.  The famous song “Rally Round the West Indies” by David Rudder is a song we love to hear around our cricketing ovals. This gives us a sense of warmth, a feeling of togetherness even through the difficult times.
					</p>

					<h3>Festivals/Music</h3>
					<p> Festivals play an important role in the Caribbean identity and bring the people from all over the region. Whether Carnival in Trinidad or Crop over in Barbados, these festivals showcase the identity of the Caribbean society with similar backgrounds. The Crop Over tradition was started in the year 1687 to celebrate the end of the sugar cane season where the last of the season’s sugar cane crop was delivered to the mill yard. They would dance and play music with instruments created from bones celebrating the wonderful times. Crop Over has now evolved into Barbados’ biggest national festival, similar to Carnival in Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago, with parties, dancing and beautiful costumes.
						The evolution of the Crop Over Festival as a Harvest Festival has its origins embedded in the history of the sugar cane plantations of the colonial period, where slaves married an African Yam Festival and the Englishman’s Harvest Home Festival.Thus a merging of two cultures into one cementing once again that “all ah we is one.”  The enslaved, and later freed men, created a unique celebratory blend by transforming the Plantation mill yards into a hub of activity. (say how they celebrated) The similarity of the music we listen to in the Caribbean can show our identity and unity.  Music has been central to Caribbean culture since the days of slavery when it was a mode of mental survival and a form of recreation. Even today music is a way whereby persons use it as a mental escape.

					<h3>Language</h3>
					<p> In the Caribbean, language is a major part of our identity and the use of the creole often draws attention to the people of the region. If you go some places in the world and people hear you talk, they can automatically tell where you came from.
						Creole is a "patois" language which is a combination of African syntax and European words. It evolved out of necessity, as slaves needed to communicate with the plantation owners. Derivations include French Creole, with regional dialects in Haiti, Martinique, Guadeloupe, St. Lucia, Dominica, and French Guyana and Patois in Jamaica just to name a few. Due to Creole being associated with the poor labor class, parents would often tell their children not to speak it. In Barbados parents would tell their children “speak proper English”. However, more people are appreciating and recognizing the historical importance of the languageand why it is an integral part of our Caribbean identity.
						</p>

						<h3>Food</h3>
					<p> Throughout the Caribbean, food is a great representative of our cultural identity. Many of the food dishes were made up of ground provisions such as sweet potatoes, yam, eddoes and cassava. These would’ve come from the planting of from the enslaved in the past. Today dishes like pudding and souse are commonly eaten in Barbados. Pudding and souse came about due to the white slave masters giving the enslaved the scraps of meat which they used to make the dish. This is an excellent form of our identity which can be seen in Barbados, all of these things truly show “all ah we is one.”</p>
